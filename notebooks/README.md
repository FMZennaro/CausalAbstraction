# Causal Abstraction - Notebooks

A series of notebooks containing tutorials, reproduction of work in the literature, and open notes on the problem of abstraction of structural causal models (starting from a categorical framework).

## Contents

1. **Categorical Abstraction**: A tutorial notebook in which we explore the idea of abstraction between causal models following the framework presented in [Rischel2020] and illustrating the main ideas by replicating (theoretically and experimentally) the examples in Sections 4.11-4.13 of [Rischel2020].
