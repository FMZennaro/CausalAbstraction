# Causal Abstraction - Notebooks

A series of notebooks containing tutorials, reproduction of work in the literature, and open notes on the problem of abstraction of structural causal models (starting from a categorical framework).

## Contents

1. **Categorical Abstraction**: A tutorial notebook in which we explore the idea of abstraction between causal models following the framework presented in [Rischel2020] and illustrating the main ideas by replicating (theoretically and experimentally) the examples in Sections 4.11-4.13 of [Rischel2020].

2. **Abstraction Mapping**: A notebook in which we take a closer look at the definition of abstraction between causal models that was presented in [Rischel2020] and reviewed in the previous notebook. Along with the theoretical discussion we also implement classes to encode SCMs and abstractions.

3. **Transformations and Abstractions**: Another tutorial notebook where we consider the concept of transformation and exact transformations from [Rubenstein2017] and we perform a first example-driven comparison between abstractions [Rischel2020] and transformations.

4. **Automating Abstraction Error**: In this notebook we automate the estimation of abstraction error using the framework introduced in [Rischel2020] and explored in the notebook *Categorical Abstraction*. We implement a function that estimate abstraction error as a function of a chosen evaluation set and metric.
