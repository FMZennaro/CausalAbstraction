Although $\\tau$ itself is not surjective, the domain level function $\\alpha_S$ and $\\alpha_C$ may in principle be made surjective as both outcomes $0$ and $1$ for $S$ and $C$ are in the co-domain of $\\tau$.\n",

In other words, the outcomes of the high-level model in terms of $S$ and $C$ are completely determined by the low-level variable $C$. To all effects, the low-level variable $S$ is irrelevant, although not explicitly defined as such by the set $R$. We are then unable to find two surjective functions $\\alpha_S$ and $\\alpha_C$ with domains $\\mathcal{M}[S]$ and $\\mathcal{M}[C]$ that have the same behaviour as the transformation $\\tau$.\n",
