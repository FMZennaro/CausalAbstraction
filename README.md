# Causal Abstraction

Code, notebooks and resources on the problem of abstraction of structural causal models.

## Contents

- **src**: up-to-date source code for implementing and working with abstractions between SCMs.

- **notebooks**: collection of notebooks providing introduction, tutorial and reproductions of work in the literature.

- **papers**: resources related to specific publications.

- **legacy**: legacy code required to run some notebooks.


## Disclaimers

**This is a work in progress**: code and notebooks are executable, but in continuous development. TODO sections are sprinkled across the notebooks and the code.

**Feedbacks are welcome**: mistakes are in all likelihood due to my misunderstandings  and suggestions/corrections are very welcome! :)

**References**: content often refers to ideas from *causality* and *category theory*. Useful references for causality are [Pearl2009,Peters2017], while for category theory are [Spivak2014,Fong2018].
